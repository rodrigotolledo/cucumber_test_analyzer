Feature: Addition
  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario: Add two numbers FILE2 SC3           # /Users/Thoughtworks/Documents/my_stuff/TCC2-here-we-go/test_app/step_definitions/calculator/addition2.feature:18
    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator # /Users/Thoughtworks/Documents/my_stuff/TCC2-here-we-go/test_app/step_definitions/calculator/addition_steps.rb:5
    And I have entered 70 into the calculator   # /Users/Thoughtworks/Documents/my_stuff/TCC2-here-we-go/test_app/step_definitions/calculator/addition_steps.rb:5
    When I press add                            # /Users/Thoughtworks/Documents/my_stuff/TCC2-here-we-go/test_app/step_definitions/calculator/addition_steps.rb:9
    Then the result should be 120 on the screen # /Users/Thoughtworks/Documents/my_stuff/TCC2-here-we-go/test_app/step_definitions/calculator/addition_steps.rb:13
