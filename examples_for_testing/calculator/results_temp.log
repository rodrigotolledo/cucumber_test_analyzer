Feature: Addition
  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario: Add two numbers                     # addition3.feature:18
    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator # addition3.feature:19
    And I have entered 70 into the calculator   # addition3.feature:20
    When I press add                            # addition3.feature:21
    Then the result should be 120 on the screen # addition3.feature:22

1 scenario (1 undefined)
4 steps (4 undefined)
0m0.002s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I have entered (\d+) into the calculator$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I press add$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^the result should be (\d+) on the screen$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

If you want snippets in a different programming language,
just make sure a file with the appropriate file extension
exists where cucumber looks for step definitions.
