Feature: code-breaker starts game
  As a code-breaker
  I want to start a game
  So that I can break the code

  Scenario: start game                          # codebreaker_starts_game.feature:6
    Given I am not yet playing                  # step_definitions/codebreaker_steps.rb:1
    When I start a new game                     # step_definitions/codebreaker_steps.rb:5
    Then I should see "Welcome to Codebreaker!" # step_definitions/codebreaker_steps.rb:10
    And I should see "Enter guess:"             # step_definitions/codebreaker_steps.rb:10
